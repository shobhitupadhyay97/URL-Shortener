<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="http://0.0.0.0:3000/"><em>URL Shortener</em></a> is an application build using 
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> programming language. URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://snip.ml/Foo", and the URL "https://example.com/about/index.html" can be shortened to "https://snip.ml/h2iBY". Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original one. A friendly URL may be desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters in a message (for example SMS), for reducing the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source, for making it easier for a person to remember, or for the intention of a permalink.
